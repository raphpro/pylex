# pylex
These modules provide lexical analysis for Python language tokens.

Please note that the config file 'Pylex.configs.xlsx' is unfinished. It does not include all pylang tokens. If you fork this repo you will have to finish the list yourself.
All other code is finished. Pylex will work for all the tokens already included in the config file.

Please visit (https://anaconda.org/raphpro/pylex/notebook) to see a demo of pylex in jupyter notebook using the unfinished config file.
